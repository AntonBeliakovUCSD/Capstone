                                        <p class="text-muted">As the number of causal SNPs increases per gene id, itâ€™s heritability on average
                                            increases. This contradicts our hypothesis. A potential reason this occurs is because as the 
                                            number of causal SNPs increases per gene id, then it is likely that the
                                            particular gene id has more factors that determine its occurrence, which could also
                                            make it more difficult for that gene id to be consistently heritable.</p>

                                            start and stop positions. The scores were normally distributed around 0. The
                                            range of the score is from -1 to 1, with 1 meaning highly conserved. Gene ids with

                                             we can identify the specific gene ids whose expression is significantly correlated
                                             to diseases. This is particularly effective in cancers, since it is caused by a
                                            small number of mutations. We applied this technique to identify causal SNPs in
