                                             This contradicts our hypothesis. A potential reason this occurs is that as the number of causal SNPs increases
                                              per gene ID, then it is likely that the particular gene ID has more factors that determine its occurrence, which
                                               could also make it more difficult for that gene ID to be consistently heritable.</p>

                                            start and stop positions. The scores were normally distributed around 0. The
                                            range of the score is from -1 to 1, with 1 meaning highly conserved. Gene IDs with

                                            we can identify the specific gene IDs whose expression is significantly correlated
                                            to diseases. This is particularly effective in cancers since it is caused by a
                                           small number of mutations. We applied this technique to identify causal SNPs in
