                        <H3> Our Goal </H3>
                        Our goal is to shed light on the genetic architecture of cancers by enhancing comprehension of their heritability and polygenic characteristics.
                        <br>
                        Understanding these genetic influences will better help us understand the relationship between evolution and genes which can contribute to these common cancers.

                        <H3> Our Hypothesis </H3>
                        As the number of causal SNPs increases for a gene ID, the higher its heritability is likely to be, aligning with the assumption in existing literature
                         that gene IDs or traits with few causal variants are often not highly conserved.
